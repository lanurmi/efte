OS/2 notes and limitations:
- pm controls are not disabled while a modal entryfield is active.
- pm subwindows can not be resized.
- does not handle multiple frames well (dialogs are modal for all).

Linux notes and limitations:

- Console version:
  Runs only on linux console. Requires rw access to /dev/vcsa?? devices.
  Runs in raw mode, so switch consoles using Ctrl+Alt+Fn. Currently
  operates in no-translation screen mode. Console cut/paste does not currently
  work.

- X11 version:
  If your backspace key does not work, make sure it is defined as
  BackSpace (using loadkeys/xmodmap).

- Some stuff may still be OS/2 centric. This will be fixed
  in the future.
